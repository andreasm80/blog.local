Lead Solution Engineer @VMware. Been working as an IT consultant since 2004. Where my key areas were delivering professional services on VMware solutions specializing in VMware vSphere, VMware NSX, VSAN, DR-solutions and Hybrid-Cloud. I think I have touched all products coming from VMware since 2003. Some of my certifications are VCIX-DCV, VCIX-NV.

Areas of interest: Virtulization, Neworking, Security, Linux, OpenSource solutions, BSD, DiY projects, home-automation etc..

I created this blog page for many years ago where one of the purposes was to use it as my "knowledge" base for different stuff I deploy in my lab. It primarily focuses around my line of work (solutions such as VMware NSX and Tanzu), but will also add other topics out of work scope (different DiY projects, home automation).  

\* Wikis, howtos, tips/trick and troubleshooting issues mainly within my own field of competence, as a contribution back to the community for all the help they have given me over the years. Which has been, and still is, very appreciated. Sharing is actually caring.
