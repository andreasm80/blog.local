            Abbreviations used in this article:
NSX Advanced Load Balancer = NSX-ALB K8s = Kubernetes (8 letters between the K and s in Kubernetes) SSL = Secure Sockets Layer AKO = Avi Kubernetes Operator (AVI now a VMware product called NSX Advanced Load Balancer) In one of my previous posts I wrote about how to install and configure AKO (Avi Kubernetes Operator) to use as Service type LoadBalancer.
This post will try to cover the basics of how to use NSX Advanced LoadBalancer by using AKO to handle our Ingress requests (ingress-controller).
