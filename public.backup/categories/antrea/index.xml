            This post will go through the Antrea-native policy resources and how to use them to secure your Kubernetes environment combined with K8s network policies.
Abbreviations used in this article:
Container Network Interface = CNI Antrea Cluster Network Policies = ACNP Antrea Network Policies = ANP Kubernetes Network Policies = K8s policies or KNP When it comes to securing your K8s infrastructure it can be done in several layers in the infrastructure as a whole.

            What is the NSX Antrea integration Assumptions: I assume that the reader is aware of what Antrea is, and what a CNI is and also what NSX is. If not head over here to read more on Antrea and here to read more on NSX.
For many years VMware NSX has help many customer secure their workload by using the NSX Distributed Firewall. As NSX has evolved over the years the different platform it supports has also broadened, from virtual machines, bare metal server, cloud workload and kubernetes pods.

            This week I was fortunate to get hold of a VMC on AWS environment and wanted to test out the possibility of managing my K8s security policies from my on-prem NSX manager by utilizing the integration of Antrea in NSX. I haven&#39;t covered that specific integration part in a blog yet, but in short: by using Antrea as your CNI and you are running NSX-T 3.2 you can manage all your K8s policies from the NSX manager GUI.

            This is an introduction post to Antrea, what it is and which features it has.
For more details head over to:
https://antrea.io/ and https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea
First of, Antrea is a CNI. CNI stands for Container Network Interface. As the world moves into Kubernetes more and more, we need a good CNI to support everything from network to security within Kubernetes. Thats where Antrea comes into play.
Antrea has a rich set of features such as:

            This post will cover the steps to bring up a Kubernetes cluster in Ubuntu, then how to install and configure Antrea as CNI and how to install and configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer to use as a servicetype Load Balancer in the k8s environment with the use of Avi Kubernetes Operator.
Abbreviations used in this post:
NSX Advanced Load Balancer = NSX ALB Avi Kubernetes Operator = AKO Kubernetes = k8s Container Network Interface = CNI Load Balancer = lb Introduction to this post When working with pods in a k8s cluster there is often the use of nodePort, clusterIP and LoadBalancer.
