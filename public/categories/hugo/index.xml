            This blog post will cover how I wanted to deploy Hugo to host my blog-page.
Preparations To achieve what I wanted, deploy an highly available Hugo hosted blog page, I decided to run Hugo in Kubernetes. For that I needed
Kubernetes cluster, obviously, consisting of several workers for the the &amp;quot;hugo&amp;quot; pods to run on (already covered here. Persistent storage (NFS in my case, already covered here) An Ingress controller (already covered here) A docker image with Hugo, nginx and go (will be covered here) Docker installed so you can build the image A place to host the docker image (Docker hub or Harbor registry will be covered here) Create the Docker image Before I can deploy Hugo I need to create an Docker image that contains the necessary bits.
